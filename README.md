## Notable differences to the original project

- Merged all open RP on original repository.
- Compatibility with Python >=3.9 and Robot Framework 7.
- Added `edge` recognition strategy using OpenCV (`cv2`) for robust matching on screens with pixel deviations.
- Additional edge preprocessing filters (`gaussian`, `median`, `erode`, `dilate`) for the `edge` recognition strategy.
- Optional multi-scale search that can be enabled with `Set Scale Range`.
- Optional hot reload mode that refreshes reference image paths before image-based keywords run.
- Keywords such as `Wait For`, `Locate`, and `Locate All` now have a working timeout function and return the correlation score (`score`) and detected scaling factor (`scale`).
- Debugger now displays the best match score for located images.
- Edge detection result messages in the debugger have been simplified.
- `Take A Screenshot` keyword can now capture a specific `region` or `window`.
- Reference image names are normalized automatically:
  - Names are converted to lowercase.
  - Spaces are replaced with underscores `_`.
  - `.png` is appended if missing; `.PNG` is accepted with a warning if casing differs from the file on disk.
  - The reference folder path is prepended when using `reference_folder`.
- Installation metadata managed via `pyproject.toml`, updated dependencies and removed deprecated `setup.py|cfg` files.
- Removed unused dependencies and replaced `scikit-image` with headless OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`).
- New keywords `Move Rel`, `Drag To`, `Drag Rel`, `Scroll`, `Scroll Horizontally`, `Scroll Vertically`, `Set Global Pause`, and `Set Failsafe` from the `PyAutoGUI` library.
- Various documentation improvements, implemented new tests, dropped pytest dependency and added safe version handling.

## Introduction

This Robot Framework library provides facilities to automate GUIs based on
image recognition similar to Sikuli, but without any Java dependency (100% Python).

There are two different recognition strategies: _default_ (using `pyautogui`)
and _edge_ (using OpenCV (`cv2`)). For non pixel perfect matches, there is a feature
called "confidence level" that allows to define the percentage of pixels which
_must_ match. In the _default_ strategy, confidence comes with a dependency to
OpenCV (`opencv-python`). This functionality is optional - you are not required
to install `opencv-python` if you do not use confidence level.

By default ImageHorizonLibrary uses the `default` strategy. The `edge`
strategy can be enabled when dealing with screens that contain unpredictable
pixel deviations.

## Edge preprocessing

When using the `edge` recognition strategy you can optionally apply a
pre-processing filter before edge detection. This requires OpenCV (`cv2`)
and is enabled with the `edge_preprocess` argument. Supported filters are
`gaussian`, `median`, `erode` and `dilate`. The size of the filter kernel
can be adjusted with `edge_kernel_size` (default is 3).

The filters have the following effects:

- `gaussian` – applies an additional Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
- `median` – replaces each pixel with the median of the neighbourhood to
  remove salt-and-pepper noise while preserving edges.
- `erode` – shrinks bright regions which can help remove small artifacts.
- `dilate` – expands bright regions to close small gaps.

Example:

```robotframework
| Set Strategy | edge | edge_preprocess=gaussian | edge_kernel_size=5 |
```

## Edge detection parameters

The `edge` strategy exposes three parameters that control the Canny edge
detector:

- `edge_sigma` – width of the Gaussian blur applied before edge
  extraction. Larger values smooth the image more aggressively which can
  reduce noise but may remove fine details.
- `edge_low_threshold` – lower gradient magnitude threshold (0.0–1.0).
  Edges with a value below this threshold are discarded.
- `edge_high_threshold` – upper gradient magnitude threshold (0.0–1.0).
  Values above this are considered strong edges. Edges between the two
  thresholds are kept only if connected to a strong edge.

Additional usage examples for the `edge` strategy:

```robotframework
| # use with auto-detected parameters
| Set Strategy | edge |
| Click Image | button.PNG |
| # provide explicit thresholds and confidence
| Set Strategy | edge | edge_sigma=2.0 | edge_low_threshold=0.1 | edge_high_threshold=0.3 | confidence=0.9 |
| # enable edge preprocessing with a custom kernel
| Set Strategy | edge | edge_preprocess=median | edge_kernel_size=7 |
```

Keywords such as `Wait For`, `Locate`, and `Locate All` return not only the match coordinates
but also the correlation score and an optional detected scaling factor
describing the match quality. The typical return signature is:

```robotframework
${x} ${y} ${score} ${scale}= | Wait For | example.png | timeout=5 |
```

The `score` ranges from `-1` (no correlation) to `1` (perfect match) and the
`scale` value is `1.0` when no resizing is detected.

ImageHorizonLibrary searches only at scale `1.0` by default. To enable
multi-scale matching (for example `0.8`–`1.2`), use:

```robotframework
| Set Scale Range | 0.8 | 1.2 | 9 |
```

Call `Reset Scale Range` to disable multi-scale search again.

## Hot reload

By default, ImageHorizonLibrary builds its reference image lookup when the
library is imported or when `Set Reference Folder` / `Add Reference Folder` is
used. If your tests create, remove or replace reference images while a suite is
running, enable hot reload so image-based keywords refresh the lookup before
resolving the image name.

```robotframework
| Hot Reload | true |
| Click Image | generated_button.png |
| Hot Reload | false |
```

Convenience keywords are also available:

```robotframework
| Enable Hot Reload |
| Locate | generated_button.png |
| Disable Hot Reload |
```

Use `Refresh Reference Images` when you want to rebuild the lookup once without
leaving automatic hot reload enabled.

## Prerequisites

- Python >=3.9
- pip (via `python3 -m pip`) for easy installation
- Robot Framework

On Ubuntu, you need to take [special measures](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.org/en/latest/screenshot.html#special-notes-about-ubuntu)
to make the screenshot functionality work correctly. The keyboard functions
might not work on Ubuntu when run in VirtualBox on Windows.

## Installation

If you have pip, installation is straightforward:

```bash
python3 -m pip install robotframework-imagehorizonlibrary
```

This will automatically install dependencies as well as their dependencies.

If you want to use the optional Image Debugger that relies on matplotlib,
install the library with the `debug` extra:

```bash
python3 -m pip install "robotframework-imagehorizonlibrary[debug]"
```

### Windows

ImageHorizonLibrary should work on Windows "out-of-the-box". Just run the
commands above to install it.

### macOS

_NOTICE_ ImageHorizonLibrary does not currently work with XCode v.8. Please use a previous version.
You additionally need to install these for `pyautogui`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pyobjc-core pyobjc
```

For these, you need to install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/).

### Linux

You additionally need to install these for `pyautogui`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-xlib
```

You might also need, depending on your Python distribution, to install:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

If you are using virtualenv, you must install [python-xlib](http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-xlib/files/)
manually to the virtual environment for `pyautogui`:

- Fetch the source distribution
- Install with:
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install python-xlib-<latest version>.tar.gz
  ```

## Building from source

To create a wheel from the current sources without installing runtime
dependencies, first ensure the build requirements are available:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel packaging
```

Then build the wheel:

```bash
pip wheel . --no-deps
```

## Building with Docker

Dockerfiles are provided to build wheels in isolated environments.

### x86_64

```bash
docker build -t imagehorizonlib-wheel .
CID=$(docker create imagehorizonlib-wheel)
docker cp $CID:/work/dist ./dist
docker rm $CID
```

### arm64

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.arm64 -t imagehorizonlib-wheel:arm64 .
CID=$(docker create imagehorizonlib-wheel:arm64)
docker cp $CID:/work/dist ./dist
docker rm $CID
```

## Running unit tests

```bash
python3 tests/utest/run_tests.py [verbosity=2]
```

## Running acceptance tests

Additionally to unit test dependencies, you also need OpenCV, Eel, Scrot and Chrome/Chromium browser.
OpenCV is used because these tests are testing also confidence level.
Browser is used by Eel for cross-platform GUI demo application.
`scrot` is used for capturing screenshots.

```bash
sudo apt install scrot chromium-browser
python3 -m pip install opencv-python eel
export RUN_GUI_TESTS=1
python3 tests/atest/run_tests.py
```

## Updating docs

To regenerate documentation (`docs/ImageHorizonLibrary.html`), use this command:

```bash
python3 -m robot.libdoc -P ./src ImageHorizonLibrary docs/ImageHorizonLibrary.html
cp docs/ImageHorizonLibrary.html docs/index.html
```

The documentation is published on GitHub Pages at [https://3x3cut0r.github.io/robotframework-imagehorizonlibrary/](https://3x3cut0r.github.io/robotframework-imagehorizonlibrary/).
